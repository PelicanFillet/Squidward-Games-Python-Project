# Squidward-Games-Python-Project
An interactive, multi-leveled story based videogame built using Spyder Compiler for an intro to Python class.

The goal of this project is to create, market, and sell a themed videogame to a group of investors.  I presented this project to a panel of judges who graded our code base, presentation skills, storyline, and group cohesion.

--------------------------------------------------------------
                     GRADE RECIEVED: A
--------------------------------------------------------------

Concepts used to create this game include:
-If statements
-While/For loops
-Object oriented programming
-Lists
-Dictionaries
-Functions
-Exception handling
-Modules(random, time)

----------------------------
LEVEL 1 - DOOR GUESSING GAME
----------------------------
>This level uses a while loops that interacts with the global variable system 
>As long as you have lives, you get a chance of guessing a correct door out of 3 options
>The correct door is randomized each attempt, giving a 33.33% chance of passing level 1

-------------------------------
LEVEL 2 - ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
-------------------------------
>User plays against opponent who will randomly pick rock, paper, or scissors
>First to win 3 will win, and user will progress or get sent to start
>33.33% chance to win against opponent each go around
>Lives system interacts with global variable

-----------------
LEVEL 3 - HANGMAN
-----------------
>Program will pull random word from dictionary and ask user to input word to begin game
>User knows the length of the word and knows the general theme of what the word could be
>As wrong guesses accumulate, a graphic of a hanged man will get more and more complete
>If the hanged man is complete, you lose the game
